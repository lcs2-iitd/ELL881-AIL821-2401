title: "11. Scaling Laws"

tldr: "Discussion on emergent abilities of LLMs. Understanding the empirical scaling laws for neural language model performance on the cross-entropy loss &ndash; Kaplan laws, Chinchilla scaling laws. Discussion on an alternative perspective on emergent abilities &ndash; are these abilities really 'emergent'?"
