# Problem Statements
We are floating six problem statements as part of the course project. Please refer to [this doc](/_ELL881_AIL821 - Course Projects.pdf) for details. The other instructions are listed in the attached project doc. Please adhere to them.

# Group Formation
Each problem statement can be selected by a maximum of 6 groups on FCFS basis. Each group can have two members at maximum. Please enter your group details corresponding to the chosen project on [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15H_FOjUqb9ookBhpWku2qzSdAz1LdFWKyLISBsSAoYQ/edit?gid=1519277742#gid=1519277742). 

If you want to do a project based on a self-proposed problem statement, please indicate it in the sheet and discuss it with Prof. Tanmoy after the class or meet him in his office - taking the professor's clearance to pursue the self-proposed project is mandatory!
